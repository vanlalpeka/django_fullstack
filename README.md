This is a fullstack Django app with minimal features (listed below).
The intention is to use this as a (boilerplate) starting point to accelerate development.

Django plugins are used to enable the following features:
1. Invite only registration
2. Bulk import-export data (.xlsx, .xls, .csv) from Admin screens
3. Automated tests using pytest 
4. Google's Material UI styling
5. Postgresql datatabase integration
6. Phone number data management
